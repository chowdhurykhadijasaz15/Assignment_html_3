It was also a war of supreme sacrifice.About three million people died in this war, most of them died in the genocide carried out by the Pkistan army. On March 25, the army launched a massive attack in which there were heavycasualties.Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib was arrested and flown to West Pakistan. Before that, he declared the <span>independence of Bangladesh</span>.Most of the Awami Leaders fled and set up a govornment-in-excile in Calcutta, declaring Bangladesh an independent state.Internal resistance was mobilized by some bengali units of the regular army,notably by Major Zia-ur-Rahman. Eventually, on DEc3,1971, the indian army invaded the territory of its neighbor.The Pakistani army surrendered on December 16. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from jail and return to a hero's welcome, assuming leadership of the new Bangladesh government in January 1972.Our vitory in the war of independence was a hard earned one.
